Get ATHLETE_DF test results
Get CRITERIA 

Put criteria in a list of lists 
  EG.. Bowling: 505: >50, VJ > 40
       Football: 505 >90, VJ > 80, Gender = Male
       Gymnastics: Height < 40, yBalance > 90, Gender = Female
       

Function for criteria_match (athlete, sport_criteria)

  For each sport in criteria (loops through all sport):
    For each criterion (loops through all criterions):
    
    Athlete Value = Value of criterion
  
      If Athlete Value is NA, NEXT (skip)
    
        Extract treshold value and convert to numeric
          If criterion is ">" , 
              If athlete value < treshold value return FALSE (fails condition, STOP)
            
            Else if criterion is "<",
                If athlete value > treshold value return FALSE (fails condition, STOP)
                
            ELSE criterion is '=',
              If athlete value not equal to treshold value return FALSE (fails condition, STOP)
              
          RETURN TRUE (PASS, match for this sport)

USE CASE EXAMPLE 
Athlete 1 

505: 70
VJ: 50
Height: 30
Gender: Female
yBalance = 95

Should qualify for GYMNASTICS and BOWLING

For BOWLING,
  For 505,
  Yes, exists in athlete data
    treshold value = 50
      
      If criterion is > ,
        70 (athlete value) is more than 50 (treshold value) CONTINUE
      
   For VJ,
    treshold value = 40
      
      If criterion is >,
      50 (athlete value) is more than 40 (treshold value) CONTINUE
   
  
  RETURN TRUE (match! STOP)
  
FOR FOOTBALL,
  For 505,
    treshold value = 90,
      
      If criterion is >,
        50 (athlete value) is less than 90 (treshold value) 

  return FALSE (No Match! STOP)
        
FOR GYMNASTICS,
  
  For HEIGHT, 
    treshold value = 40
    
      If criterion is <,
        30 (athlete value) is less than 40 CONTINUE 
  
  For yBalance,
    treshold value = 90
      
      If criterion is >,
        90 (athlete value) is 90 CONTINUE
        
  For Gender,
    value = Female
      
      If criterion is =,
        female (athlete value) = criteria CONTINUE
        
  RETURN TRUE (Match Sport, STOP!)
  
  
start an empty list for matched sport 

For each athlete in the dataframe
    
    apply function criteria_match(Athlete, CRITERIA)
    
    if nothing is returned (empty), return 'OTHERS' 
    
    store result in matched sport list
    
    matched sport list
